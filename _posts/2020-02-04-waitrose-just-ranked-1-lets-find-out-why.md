For a second time, [Waitrose has been ranked the best supermarket in the UK by Which?, a UK-based consumer reports organization](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51586870). However, a spokesperson from Asda, one of the 'big four' supermarkets that had performed poorly in the study, pointed out that 70% of Which?'s respondents had not visited an Asda location in the last six months.

When our team read that discrepancy in the the study, we decided to take a closer look at why Waitrose performed so highly as well as what consumers actually think about Asda.

### **At first glance**

Our sample focused on London supermarkets; 35 Asda, 66 Waitrose locations and a handful of Lidl, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury's locations. Our analysis was powered by BasilCX, our in-house engine that aggregates and transforms online, geolocated data into concise analytics through AI.&nbsp;

Immediately, you're able to see different concentrations of Asda (green dots) and Waitrose (purple dots) across London. Different geographic concentrations suggest different consumer groups, preferences and values.

Across all locations, we can see that "Staff and Service" was the most frequently mentioned topic by consumers, with nearly twice the number of mentions as "selection," the second-most mentioned topic.

### Asda v. Waitrose

When isolating Asda and Waitrose, we can see a similar focus on the staff, price, selection, parking and freshness, albeit with different sentiment levels and number of mentions.&nbsp;

The major question our team had was whether Asda and Waitrose were truly so different in consumer experience. In our work, we have consistently found that consumers often find value in different aspects of their shopping experiences. For example, as someone who values the convenience of nearby public transportation or easily-accessible parking above all else, I find myself shopping wherever is most accessible, disregarding, and often content with, differences in price or the freshness of produce.

What we found matched Which?'s report for certain variables, but not nearly to the extremes that a 1 to 5 scale generates. Similar to Which?'s report, we&nbsp; found that consumers had more positive experiences with the freshness of produce at Waitrose locations, but it was Waitrose's offerings (e.g. deli counter, upstairs dining, pharmacy, bakery) and the staff and service (e.g. friendliness, helpfulness, professionalism, availability) that truly captured positive feedback from consumers.

Interestingly, freshness of produce, while a staple of the Waitrose brand, was not a major differentiator in consumer feedback of the two supermarket chains, suggesting that Asda consumers are more interested in other aspects of their shopping experience, such as the convenience and price-friendliness of Asda locations and satisfied with the freshness of produce levels at Asda locations.

### Why this matters

Each of these topics holds different levels of importance to customers, and some are more business-critical than others. For example, improvements in "Staff and Service" may improve in-store consumer experience more rapidly in Asda locations than Waitrose locations. Knowing the ROI of these associations store-by-store helps place managers, marketers and real estate teams make confident, informed decisions on their ad campaigns, location placement and in-store optimization.
