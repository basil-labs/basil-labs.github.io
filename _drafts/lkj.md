For a second time, [Waitrose has been ranked the best supermarket in the UK by Which?, a UK-based consumer reports organization](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51586870). However, a spokesperson from Asda, one of the 'big four' supermarkets that had performed poorly in the study, pointed out that 70% of Which?'s respondents had not visited an Asda location in the last six months.

When our team read that discrepancy in the the study, we decided to take a closer look at why Waitrose performed so highly as well as what consumers actually think about Asda.
