For a second time, [Waitrose has been ranked the best supermarket in the UK by Which?, a UK-based consumer reports organization](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51586870). However, a spokesperson from Asda, one of the 'big four' supermarkets that had performed poorly in the study, pointed out that 70% of Which?'s respondents had not visited an Asda location in the last six months.

When our team read that discrepancy in the the study, we decided to take a closer look at why Waitrose performed so highly as well as what consumers actually think about Asda.

### **At first glance**

Our sample focused on London supermarkets; 35 Asda, 66 Waitrose locations and a handful of Lidl, Marks & Spencer and Sainsbury's locations. Our analysis was powered by BasilCX, our in-house engine that aggregates and transforms online, geolocated data into concise analytics through AI.&nbsp;

Immediately, you're able to see different concentrations of Asda (green dots) and Waitrose (purple dots) across London. Different geographic concentrations suggest different consumer groups, preferences and values.

Across all locations, we can see that "Staff and Service" was the most frequently mentioned topic by consumers, with nearly twice the number of mentions as "selection," the second-most mentioned topic.
